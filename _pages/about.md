I am a doctoral researcher in **Computational Linguistics and Phonetics** at the **University of Zurich**, supported by the <a href='https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu'>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</a> as part of the <a href='https://www.vocs.eu.com'>Voice Communication Sciences</a> project. I am supervised by <a href='https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/about-us/people/team/phonetics/vdellw.html'>Professor Dr Volker Dellwo</a> and <a href='https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/about-us/people/team/phonetics/epelle.html'>Dr Elisa Pellegrino</a>, as well as <a href='https://brams.org/members/pascal-belin/'>Professor Pascal Belin</a> from Aix-Marseille University. Previously, I completed an **MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics** at the **University of Cambridge** (_Distinction_), where I investigated perceived voice similarity among Cantonese--English bilinguals under the supervision of <a href='https://www.phonetics.mmll.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-kirsty-mcdougall'>Dr Kirsty McDougall</a>. I also hold a **BA in Language Science** from **Shanghai International Studies University**, where I worked on my thesis exploring argument structure processing using naturalistic fMRI with <a href='https://xiaomingjiang.wordpress.com/'>Professor Xiaoming Jiang</a>.

My research focuses on the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice perception across different languages, speech contexts and temporal scales, employing behavioural, neuroscientific, and computational methods. More broadly, I am interested in topics within cognitive and language sciences, including syntactic–semantic structure and the convergence between human brains and artificial intelligence. My work has appeared in _NeuroImage_, _Behavior Research Methods_, and _Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics_.
