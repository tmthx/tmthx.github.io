I am a doctoral researcher in **Computational Linguistics and Phonetics** at the **University of Zurich**, supported by the _Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions_ as part of the *Voice Communication Sciences* project. Previously, I completed an **MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics** at the **University of Cambridge** (_Distinction_), where I investigated perceived voice similarity among Cantonese–English bilinguals. I also hold a **BA in Language Science** (_First-Class Honours_) from **Shanghai International Studies University**, where my thesis explored argument structure processing using naturalistic fMRI.

My research focuses on the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying voice perception across different languages, speech contexts and temporal scales, employing behavioural, neuroscientific, and computational methods. More broadly, I am interested in topics within cognitive and language sciences, including syntactic–semantic structure and the convergence between human brains and artificial intelligence. My work has appeared in _NeuroImage_, _Behavior Research Methods_, and _Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics_.
